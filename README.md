# Data Analytics Portfolio

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates my data analysis skills using a real-world dataset. The dataset was cleaned and processed using SQL, followed by data visualizations created in Tableau.

## Steps Taken:
1. **Dataset Acquisition**: Downloaded data from an open source.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Cleaned and transformed data using SQL queries in DBeaver.
3. **Visualization**: Created a dashboard in Tableau to visualize key insights.

## SQL Code:
Below is the SQL code I used for data cleaning:

```sql
-- Example SQL code
SELECT * FROM dataset WHERE column IS NOT NULL;
